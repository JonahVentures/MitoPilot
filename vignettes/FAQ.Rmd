## How do I fix an error with "exit status (140)"?

If your Nextflow log contains an error that looks something like this:

```
Caused by:
  Process `WF2:ANNOTATE:annotate (SAMPLE_ID)` terminated with an error exit status (140)
```

This usually indicates that the process ran out of memory (RAM).
Sometimes this will happen for all samples, other times only certain difficult samples will need more RAM.
Try using the R Shiny GUI to increase the requested memory for the process that failed, then rerun the workflow.

## How do I skip processing certain samples?

There are two ways to make MitoPilot skip a set of samples when running the Assembly or Annotate modules.

If the samples successfully finished all steps of the current module, you can lock them.
To do this, select the samples and click the `LOCK` button. 
Locking will also make those samples available for the next module.

Alternatively, instead of locking the samples, you can modify their state.
To do this, select the samples, click on the `STATE` button, then choose `Pre-Assembly (wait)` or `Pre-Annotate (wait)`.
This can be applied to any samples, regardless of whether they completed the current module.

Setting the state to `wait` can help you skip samples that produce unexpected errors and interrupt the workflow.

## How do I find more detailed output such as run scripts or log files?

MitoPilot copies the most important output files to the `out` directory. 
However, all of the scripts, logs, and outfiles created by Nextflow are saved in the `work` directory. 

The `work` directory is automatically set up by Nextflow and can be difficult to navigate.
To help with this, we provide `NF_work_dir_PROCESS-NAME.txt` files for each sample in the `out` directory. 
These files contain the path to the Nextflow working directory for a specific process and sample.

Note that in the Nextflow working directories, many files are hidden, including scripts and log files.
You can list hidden files on the command line with `ls -a`.

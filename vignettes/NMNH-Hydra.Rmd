# How to use MitoPilot on the Smithsonian Hydra computing cluster

You will need an account to access the Hyrda computing cluster. Instructions are available [here](https://confluence.si.edu/display/HPC/Hydra+Policies).

## First time setup

Dan MacGuigan has submitted a request to the Hydra team for a system-wide Nextflow module. But for now, you will need to install Nextflow on Hydra. Also, for some reason, Nextflow does not work with the Java modules on Hydra, so you also need to install Java via SDKMAN.

Login to Hydra and run the following.

```{bash eval=F}
# Nextflow installation instructions
# from https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html
cd ~
curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash # install SDKMAN
source ~/.bashrc
sdk install java 17.0.10-tem # install java
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash # install Nextflow
chmod +x nextflow # make Nextflow executable
```

There will now be an executable `nextflow` file in your home directory. You should move it to a location that is in your PATH. For example:

```{bash eval=F}
mkdir ~/bin
mv ~/nextflow ~/bin/nextflow
```
 
This allows you to call `nextflow` from anywhere on the cluster. 

## Launching RStudio server

Next, let's launch RStudio server, which we'll use to install and run MitoPilot.

- login to Hydra
- run `conda deactivate` to avoid package conflicts (may not be necessary for all users)
- run `module load tools/R/RStudio/server`
- run `start-rstudio-server` (you may be asked to run a different command if this is your first time)
- leave this cluster terminal window open 
- in a new terminal window on your local computer:
	- start an ssh tunnel by running something like `ssh -N -L 8787:compute-64-16:8787 sylvain@hydra-login01.si.edu`
	  - the exact command should have been printed by `start-rstudio-server` in your cluster terminal window
	- leave this local terminal window open
	- open a web browser and enter `http://localhost:8787` in the URL bar
	- enter your cluster login credentials to access the RStudio server
	- any commands run in this new window will execute on the cluster in the interactive session

## Installing MitoPilot

To install MitoPilot, use the RStudio server window to run the following.

```{R eval=F}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("JonahVentures/MitoPilot")
```

If the installation was successful, you're ready to start using MitoPilot!

## Launching MitoPilot

We recommend running MitoPilot within an interactive session on the cluster to avoid unnecessary computational burden on the login nodes. First, initialize an interactive session on Hydra.

```{bash eval=F}
qrsh -l h_rt=24:00:00 
```

Note that interactive sessions can run for a maximum of 24 hours. Additionally, users are limited to one active interactive session at a time.

Once the interactive session starts, you can launch RStudio server.

```{bash eval=F}
conda deactivate
module load tools/R/RStudio/server
start-rstudio-server
```

Follow the login instructions as presented above. Once you have an Rstudio server window open, run `library(MitoPilot)` to load the package.

If you need to update MitoPilot, simply run the BiocManager installation command again. If you would like to ensure that youâ€™re using the latest MitoPilot version, run `remove.packages("MitoPilot")` prior to installation.
